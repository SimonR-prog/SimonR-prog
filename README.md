### In private: 

I have just started a project where im making a website, for my brothers furniture store, in Umbraco. Still in the planning stage.

### At school:

I just finished a course for CMS-development and am now interning at Avanoria where I am part of a group tasked with redesigning the backoffice of Umbraco and starting the backoffice for the company itself.

The result from the CMS-course:
