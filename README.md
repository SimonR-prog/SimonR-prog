## Ello. 

Named Simon. Currently learning more about webb-development to hopefully one day be able to create the weird ideas I have.

I just started this organization where I will start to add things that I have learned in seperate repositories to be able to refer back to them at a later time.

### Bulletpoints: 

- ðŸŒ± We just finished a course named ASP.NET 2 in which we created alot of microservices which we then utilized in a react project in this organization: https://github.com/orgs/AspnetGroupOne/repositories
