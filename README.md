# Hello. Currently working on:

### In private: 

Currently working on a website where I can share images of stickers that I have taken on my walks around Stockholm. Going to be connected to a azure blob and a azure database for the text information.

### At school:

We are learning about CMS-systems, so we are currently learning about Umbraco and Optimizely.

In this repo I am gathering thoughts and code about optimizely so far. (Going to do the same with Umbraco)

## My organization.

I recently, this summer, made this organization to better compile my repos to better keep track of them. Check out the Ventixe part in the bottom.
